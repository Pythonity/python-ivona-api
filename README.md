Python library that helps you connect to Amazon's [IVONA][ivona] Speech Cloud
from within your Python project. All you need to use it are the
[access keys][ivona keys].

It currently only implements `CreateSpeech` and `ListVoices` endpoints,
as they should cover the vast majority of use cases. Lexicons endpoints
may be added in the future.

If you're looking for out-of-the-box solution, you should probably use
[ivona-speak][ivona speak] - it's a script that uses this library and lets you
use its functionality directly from your shell.

## Installation
From PyPI:

```
$ pip install ivona_api
```

## API
There's no proper documentation as of now, but the code is commented and
*should* be pretty straightforward to use.

That said - feel free to open a [GitHub issues][github add issue] if anything
is unclear.

## Tests
Package was tested with the help of `py.test` and `tox` on Python 2.7, 3.4, 3.5
and 3.6 (see `tox.ini`).

Code coverage is available at [Coveralls][coveralls].

To run tests yourself you need to set environment variables with secret
and access keys before running `tox` inside the repository:

```shell
$ export IVONA_ACCESS_KEY='...'
$ export IVONA_SECRET_KEY='...'
$ pip install tox
$ tox
```

## Contributions
Package source code is available at [GitHub][github].
